``du`` â€” estimate disk usage of files or directories
====================================================
Calculate the amount of disk space used by files or
directories.

For example, to calculate the amount of disk space used by
files in your home directory, use the command:

.. code-block:: bash

   du -sh ~
   
Output:

.. code-block:: console

   7.4G	.

The ``-s`` option prints a summary instead of printing 
space used by individual files. 

``-h`` makes the output human-readable.
