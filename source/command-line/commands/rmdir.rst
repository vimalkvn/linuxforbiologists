``rmdir`` â€” remove empty directory
==================================
Use ``rmdir`` followed by the name of the
directory you would like to remove:

.. code-block:: bash

   rmdir Workspace

.. attention::

   *This directory must be empty before it can be
   removed.*
   
   There should be no other files or directories within 
   that directory.
