Getting help on using commands
==============================
In most cases, you can see the complete list of options
a command supports using ``--help``:

.. code-block:: bash

   ls --help
   
Output:

.. code-block:: console

   Usage: ls [OPTION]... [FILE]...
   List information about the FILEs (the current directory by default).
   Sort entries alphabetically if none of -cftuvSUX nor --sort is specified.

   Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
     -a, --all                  do not ignore entries starting with .

   ...
   
.. note::

   To keep this discussion short, the examples in this 
   section, only includes *some* options supported by a 
   command.
