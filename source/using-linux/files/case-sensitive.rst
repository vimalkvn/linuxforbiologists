.. _case-sensitive:

File and directory names are case-sensitive
===========================================
One thing you will need to remember is that file and 
directory names in Linux are case-sensitive.

For example, a file named:

.. code-block:: console

   sequence.txt

is different from:

.. code-block:: console

   Sequence.txt

Similarly, ``Documents`` and ``documents`` are two
different directories.

Both these files or directories mentioned above, can 
exist in the same directory and can have 
different contents.
