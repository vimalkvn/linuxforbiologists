Running a Linux virtual machine
===============================
To run virtual machines of other operating systems
(guests) on your computer (host), you will need to
first install a *hypervisor* â€” software that runs
virtual machines.

Examples of hypervisors include VirtualBox, Parallels,
VMware Workstation etc., I will use VirtualBox in this book
(:numref:`fig-22a`).
