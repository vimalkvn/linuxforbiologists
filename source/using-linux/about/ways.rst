Ways to run a Linux desktop
===========================
To run a Linux desktop on your computer, you can:

1. Install a 
   :ref:`Linux distribution <linux-distribution>` or
2. Run a virtual machine

I will follow the *second* method in this book, as it
is a lot easier for new users to get started.

.. note::

   There are other possibilities, but the methods above 
   are the most common.
