Why use Galaxy?
===============
These are *some* advantages of using Galaxy.

You can:

**Upload your data**
   — and perform analysis using a *web interface*.

**Use included tools**
   — or install additional ones from the Galaxy tool shed 
   (needs a :ref:`local instance <local-instance>`).

**Use history**
   — functionality to keeps track of the jobs [1]_ you run. 
   This gives you the possibility to run them again at a 
   later time (reproducibility).

**Create workflows**
   — by combining multiple tools. The output of one tool can 
   be used as input for another.

**Share your data**
   — with other users. This includes histories, workflows etc.,
