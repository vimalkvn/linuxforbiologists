============================
These are some tasks you can accomplish using Galaxy:

- Get data from various sources (databases)
- Manipulate text data
- Convert between file formats
- Statistics
- Sort and filter data


.. note:: 

   The :doc:`exercise </command-line/exercise/index>` in
   :doc:`/command-line/index` chapter,
   can be reproduced using Galaxy, without the need
   to use the command line or install software. 
   
   You only need your input data â€” query sequence and 
   the protein sequence database.
