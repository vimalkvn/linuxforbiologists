Why run Galaxy on your computer?
--------------------------------
Running Galaxy on your computer i.e., a *local instance*,
has some advantages:

**Data storage is local**
   — on your computer, whereas, if you use a public 
   instance, it will be stored on a server, possibly 
   unencrypted [2]_.

**Access more tools**
   — that are not installed on public servers by installing
   them on your local instance.

**CPU and storage limits**
   — are dependent on your computer, whereas on public 
   servers, there are limits on CPU and storage usage per 
   user [2]_.
