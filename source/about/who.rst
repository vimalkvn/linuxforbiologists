Who is it for?
==============
If you are a student or a researcher in biological 
sciences and are new to Linux, this book will help you 
get started quickly.

The primary focus is in using graphical user interfaces 
(GUIs) to accomplish tasks, but I have also included 
methods using the command line interface.
