I got introduced to Linux and open source software while 
pursuing my Master's degree in Biotechnology at 
Madurai Kamaraj University, India. 

The idea of being able to use and modify software 
without restrictions was new and exciting to me. 
I learnt to install Linux, compile software from source 
code and even create my own Linux live CD!

This experience became valuable in 
academia, where I worked primarily in research support 
for a period of over 9 years. During this time, 
I had installed and managed Linux servers, databases,
web applications and websites, contributed in the 
development of scientific software, published 
software in repositories, and taught beginner level 
courses in Python programming and Bioinformatics.

This book is a compilation of the experiences I had gained
over time in my interactions with students, colleagues, and 
the users of our services. 
Thank you for your interest in reading it. I hope 
you will find it useful.
