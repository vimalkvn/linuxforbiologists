What you will need
==================
To follow the recipes in this book, you will 
need:

1. A Linux desktop
2. Administrator privileges

Linux desktop
-------------
The Linux and open-source world is full of choice. 

There are different versions (or distributions) 
of Linux that are available for download and use.

To ensure that you can follow this book successfully, 
:term:`Linux Mint` 20.1 is used as a *reference*
distribution. All the included recipes have been 
tested on this distribution.

.. _vm-download:

Virtual machine image
.....................
If you do not have access to a Linux desktop, you can 
download a virtual machine from the website of this 
book and use it to run a virtual machine on your 
computer (:numref:`fig-121a`).

.. _fig-121a:

.. figure:: /using-linux/images/linux-mint-virtualbox.png

   Linux Mint running in VirtualBox

Follow the steps in 
:doc:`../using-linux/virtual-machine/index` to get started.
   
What about other Linux distributions?
.....................................

Although most of the recipes will work on other Linux 
distributions, you will need to make changes in 
some cases. 

For example, the applications you use might be 
different â€” instead of the :term:`Files` file manager 
used here, you might use Nautilus or Dolphin.   

If there are problems, I recommend you download 
and use the 
:doc:`virtual machine <../using-linux/virtual-machine/index>`.

.. _admin-privileges:

Administrator privileges
------------------------
The software installation steps in this book will need 
administrator privileges. In the default configuration, 
only :term:`root` or members of the ``sudo`` user group 
will be able to install software on a Linux system. 

.. note::
   
   If you are using the :ref:`virtual machine <vm-download>`,
   distributed with this book, you do not need to do anything.

If you are not using the virtual machine, you will need 
to ensure your user account is part of the ``sudo`` group, 
to be able to install software.
