Requirements
============

The build-essential and cpanminus packages installed
----------------------------------------------------
If you do not have them installed, follow 
:doc:`../quick-and-easy/index`, and search and install 
the following packages:

1. ``build-essential``
      — installs compilers and build tools like ``make``
2. ``cpanminus``
      — script to obtain, build and install modules from 
      CPAN along with their :term:`dependencies`

.. attention:: 

   *You should not add sudo in the commands below.*
   
   This method only installs files in your home directory 
   and so does not require administrator privileges.
