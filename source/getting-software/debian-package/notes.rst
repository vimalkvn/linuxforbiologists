Notes
=====
The command-line version
------------------------
You can use the :term:`apt` package manager to install
Debian packages on the command-line.

These programs need to be updated manually
------------------------------------------
Programs installed in this manner will not *usually* be
updated automatically. So, this method should only be
used for software not available using
:doc:`../quick-and-easy/index`.

If dependencies cannot be located, installation will fail
---------------------------------------------------------
Installation of some programs might fail, if dependencies
cannot be located in software repositories. In that case,
you will need to find and install those packages
manually and then attempt to install the program again.
