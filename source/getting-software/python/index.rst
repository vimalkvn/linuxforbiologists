Python packages
===============

If your software of interest is available as a Python 
package on :term:`PyPI`, you can install it using
:term:`pip` â€” Python package installer.

.. note::

   Your software might already be available using
   :doc:`../quick-and-easy/index`. Search for package 
   names starting with ``python-``.
 
   In certain cases, installing packages in a virtual 
   environment might be a better option.
