============

Python package installer (pip)
------------------------------
To install pip, follow 
:doc:`../quick-and-easy/index` for installing software.

Search and install the ``python3-pip`` package.

.. _local-bin-path:

$HOME/.local/bin added to $PATH
-------------------------------
Packages that include commands will install them in the
``$HOME/.local/bin`` directory 
(:ref:`What is $HOME? <dollar-home>`). 

To be able to run these commands easily, you will need to 
add this directory to your ``$PATH`` variable. You can 
do so by following the steps in 
:ref:`adding-directories-to-path`. 

.. attention:: 

   *You should not add sudo in the commands below.*
   
   This method only installs files in your home directory 
   and so does not require administrator privileges.
