Getting software on Linux
=========================
In this section, I will discuss how you can get software 
on your Linux desktop.

For any software you would like to install, you can 
start with the :doc:`quick and easy <quick-and-easy/index>` 
method. It will install software available in Linux 
distribution repositories. 

If your software of interest is not available or if you need 
a different version, you can consider using the other 
methods.
