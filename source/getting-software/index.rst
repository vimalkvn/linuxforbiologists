Getting software
================
In this section, I will discuss how you can get software 
on your Linux desktop.

For any software you would like to install, you can 
start with the :doc:`quick and easy <quick-and-easy/index>` 
method. It will install software available in Linux 
distribution repositories. 

If your software of interest is not available or if you need 
a different version, you can consider using the other 
methods.

.. note::

   **A note on administrator privileges**

   The software installation steps in this guide will need
   administrator privileges. This will be mentioned in the
   :guilabel:`Requirements` section, where relevant.

   On a Linux system, only :term:`root` or members of the
   ``sudo`` user group will be able to install software
   in the default configuration.

   If you are using Linbio Desktop, you do not need to do
   anything. If not, you will need to ensure your user
   account is part of the ``sudo`` group, to be able to
   install software.
